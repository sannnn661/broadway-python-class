# A same project in production can have multiple versions. These versions are maintained using
# a version control system

# If there was no version control , then code sharing would have been difficult.
# It could be done either sharing from google-drive or pren-drive which is not that efficient

# So we need version control system for two major reasons:
# 1. For code collaboration
# 2. For version maintenance


# There are several version control systems like git, mercurial, etc.
# Git is among the most famous one

# The code written in your local system should be kept somewhere in the cloud for the safety purpose.

# We can again keep our code to google-drive or some other cloud storage.
# But they do not VCS.

# So, we keep our code in such cloud platform which understand VSC.
# For example : Github , Gitlab, Bitbucket.

# In this session we use Git and Github
