What is version control ?

=>

# A same project in production can have multiple versions. These versions are maintained using
# a version control system

# If there was no version control , then code sharing would have been difficult.
# It could be done either sharing from google-drive or pren-drive which is not that efficient

# So we need version control system for two major reasons:
# 1. For code collaboration / team collaboration
# 2. For version maintenance


# There are several version control systems like git, mercurial, etc.
# Git is among the most famous one

# The code written in your local system should be kept somewhere in the cloud for the safety purpose.

# We can again keep our code to google-drive or some other cloud storage.
# But they do not VCS.

# So, we keep our code in such cloud platform which understand VSC.
# For example : Github , Gitlab, Bitbucket.

# In this session we use Git and Github


What is Version Control ?
=> There can be different versions of the same project which should be backward compatible.
=> These different versions of the same project is maintained by a version control system
=> There are different version control systems like git, mercurial etc. Git is the most famous one.


Why to use a version control system?
=> To maintain project versions efficiently and with less manual work
=> For effective team collaboration

=> The project maintained with version control system is later uploaded somewhere in the cloud.
=> There are several cloud storage services like google drive, onedrive, S3. But these storage systems
    do not cooperate with version control (e.g. git)
=> So we should use such cloud services which understand version control. There are several such services
    for example, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket etc.
