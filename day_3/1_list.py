# Lists are the mutable datatypes in python
# They are the sequential datatypes i.e. they are iterables
# Lists are created by enclosing  elements in big brackets separated by comma


# Creating an empty list
data =[]
print(data)  # []
data = list() # using list () built-in function
print(data) #[]
