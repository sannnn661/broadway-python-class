# Lists are the mutable datatypes in python
# They are the sequential datatypes i.e. they are iterables
# Lists are created by enclosing  elements in big brackets [] separated by comma
# Unlike Array, data inside a list may or may not be of the same type


# Creating an empty list
data =[]
print(data)  # []
data = list() # using list () built-in function
print(data) # []

# Creating non-empty list

a= [1,2,3] # List with same / homogeneous data types
b=["hello","python",1,2,[4,5]] # List with different / heterogeneous datatypes
